# Mech Theory

This repository contains resources created for anyone using the mech/wholetone
note layout on their instrument, whether it's a LinnStrument or grid controller.

To use the mech layout on a LinnStrument or Launchpad X, you can use my program
[midimech](https://github.com/flipcoder/midimech).

Terminology: The term "midimech" refers to my open source project, but the terms
"mech layout" and "wholetone layout" are used now in the LinnStrument community
to refer to this layout generally.

If you find mistakes in the information here, please report it as an issue.

Thanks and have fun!
